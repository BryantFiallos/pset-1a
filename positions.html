        <p>The main job of a forward is to score goals. During the game these players are closer to the opponent's goal than the rest of the team. In order to be a good forward you need to work on your speed, dribbling, shooting ability, and <a href="https://www.completesoccerguide.com/soccer-forward/">more</a>.</p>
        <h2>Midfielder</h2>
        <img src="images\debruyne.jpg" height="380px" width="675px" />
        <p>Midfielders spend a lot of time playing different roles in a game. This is a very important position because they typically need to be good at defense and offense. Some important jobs of a midfielder are assisting the defense in making sure the opposing team doesn't get anywhere near their goal, getting the ball passed up to the forwards for them to score a goal, and making their way to the opposing team's goal and scoring if the opportunity arises. In order to be a good midfielder you need to work on your passing, control, dribbling, and <a href="https://www.completesoccerguide.com/soccer-center-midfielder/">more</a>.</p>
        <h2>Defenders</h2>
        <img src="images\vandijk.jpg" height="380px" width="675px" />
        <p>The main job of a defender is to defend and make sure that the ball does not get past them. Throughout the game defenders will typically stay in their own half of the field unless their team is pressing up high. In order to be a good defender you need to work on heading, communication, tackling, and <a href="https://www.completesoccerguide.com/soccer-defender/">more</a>.</p>
        <h2>Goalkeeper</h2>
        <img src="images\stegen.jpg" height="380px" width="675px" />
        <p>The goalie is the only player that is allowed to touch the ball with their hands while on the field. The goalkeeper's responsibility is to keep the ball from getting in their net. During the game the goalie will typically not leave the goal box. In order to be a good goalkeeper you need to work on reactions, positioning, diving, and <a href="https://soccer.epicsports.com/howto-soccer-goalie.html">more</a>.</p>
