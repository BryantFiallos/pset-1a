        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Game Regulations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A soccer match is played by two opposing teams.</li>
          <li>A match is made up of two 45 minute halves.</li>
          <li>Unlike most other sports, the clock in soccer counts up instead of down. Because the clock in soccer does not stop, the referee will add stoppage time at the end of each half. This is time that was lost due to the game stopping.</li>
          <li>A coin toss determines which team will get the ball first. At the start of the second half, the other team will get the ball.</li>
          <li>Teams start in their own half of the field. The team starting on defense must be outside of the center circle.</li>
          <li>At the start of the match the ball is placed on the center mark. A player from the team who won the coin toss must kick the ball in order to initiate play. This player cannot touch the ball again until it is touched by another player from either team.</li>
          <li>Players may use any part of their body to play the ball except their hands and arms. The exception is on a throw in.</li>
          <li>A ball is out of bounds when it crosses the endline or sideline completely. A player may go out of bounds in order to keep a ball in play.</li>
        </ul>
